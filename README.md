## About the project

The Overtone Sketchpad is a Google Summer of Code project which aims to create an IDE inspired by [Processing](processing.org) for programming audio with [Clojure](clojure.org) and [Overtone](http://overtone.github.com/). Like Processing, the goal is to create an editor and project management application simple enough for a child to download, load an example, and click run. Beyond that it will provide a centralized UI to incorporate new Overtone GUI elements, manage Overtone projects, live code with repl driven development, and most of all worry about sound design and not platforms, dependencies, and enviroments. The project will be built on top of [Clooj](https://github.com/arthuredelstein/clooj) and [seesaw](https://github.com/daveray/seesaw). 

There is a [wiki](https://github.com/ghostandthemachine/overtone-sketchpad/wiki/Overtone-Sketchpad-Features-and-Design-Wiki) setup for sharing ideas and features so please feel free to jump in the conversation.
